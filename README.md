# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduler

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is an online tool that aims to illustrate various CPU scheduling algorithms graphically. It offers an interactive medium to comprehend how processes are executed and scheduled, presenting results in the form of an animated Gantt chart.

This simulator supports a variety of scheduling algorithms like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive), Round Robin (RR), and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). It allows one to enter several processes, define their properties, and view the execution order in real-time. The simulator also shows important performance measures like average waiting time, turnaround time, and throughput.

Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the simulator has a responsive UI with smooth animations. It ensures an engaging and intuitive user experience, simplifying complex scheduling concepts.

To operate the simulator, begin by inputting process information such as Task ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority (if applicable). Then choose a scheduling algorithm from the drop-down list. If employing Round Robin, input the time quantum. Lastly, click "Start Simulation" to see the scheduling process and study the performance statistics.
